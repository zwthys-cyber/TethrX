# TethrX

*A client for Grok Build — independent, not affiliated with xAI.*


Drive **Grok Build** running on your computer from your **iPhone**

Your phone is only a control plane. Grok, its tools, and your code stay on your machine; the phone sends prompts, watches Grok work **tool-by-tool**, and **approves or rejects** each action.

**[Download on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/tethrx/id6792520305)** — free, iPhone and iPad, iOS 17+. You still run the bridge yourself (below).

For TrollStore/iOS 17, download the unsigned IPA from the
**[latest GitHub release](https://github.com/zwthys-cyber/TethrX/releases/latest)**.

- **`bridge/`** — a zero-dependency Node daemon that wraps your installed `grok` and exposes it over an authenticated HTTP + SSE API. Two transports: **ACP** (default — streams tool calls, plans, and live approve/reject) and **headless** (simple text+thought).
- **`ios/`** — a native SwiftUI app (xAI design language): pairing, session list, and a live console with tool activity and approval cards. The same project builds the widgets, the share extension and the **watchOS app**, which talks only to the phone.

Everything below is **built and tested** against a real `grok` install.

---

## What the app does

- **Live console** — Grok's reasoning, tool calls, **command output**, and file diffs as they happen, with code rendered as real blocks you can scroll and copy, syntax highlighted.
- **Watch the plan** — Grok keeps a checklist while it works; the app shows it as one card that updates in place, so you can see which step it is on and how many are left.
- **Real diffs** — before and after are interleaved into a unified diff, untouched lines are folded away, and on a one-for-one change the characters that actually changed are marked.
- **Approvals** — nothing runs until you tap, and you can answer **straight from the session list** without opening the conversation. Commands that delete, overwrite, publish or touch credentials say so on the card, in a line about *that* command. Also answerable straight from the notification — including **Deny & explain**, which refuses and tells Grok what to do instead in one step.
- **Plan mode** — read the plan before Grok builds it.
- **Review the work** — changed files, per-file diffs, and **commit or discard** from the phone.
- **Browse the project** — the session's file tree and any text file, read-only, from the phone.
- **Attach images** — send a screenshot or mockup; the bridge saves it and Grok views the file with its vision-capable read tool. **Pictures Grok generates** show up in the reply, loaded from that session's `images/` folder. **Text files** from Files or iCloud ride along in the prompt, named and fenced, for the log or config that only exists on your phone.
- **Scheduled tasks** — "weekdays at 9: pull main and run the tests", fired on your computer's clock, results pushed to your phone.
- **Slash commands** — grok's skills, plus the built-ins the app can honor.
- **Queued follow-ups** — line up the next instructions and put your phone away. The queue lives on your computer, so it survives closing the app, and picks up again after a reboot.
- **Reply from the notification** — type the next instruction on the lock screen; it's queued without opening the app.
- **Share into a session** — send a link, some text, or a screenshot from any app straight to Grok via the share sheet.
- **Branch a session** — fork the conversation so a second one starts knowing everything the first one knows, for trying another approach without losing this one.
- **Voice dictation** and reusable prompt snippets.
- **Sessions** — model-generated topic titles in the conversation language, model selection for new sessions, search across conversations, find inside one, folders, transcript export, and several paired computers you can switch between. The list is ordered by what happened last, stays live on its own, and a running or blocked session says how long it has been that way.
- **Siri** — start a task or ask what Grok is doing without opening the app.
- **Apple Watch** — the sessions on your wrist, the command Grok is blocked on with the same one-line reason the phone shows, and Approve / Deny / **Deny & explain**. Dictate a follow-up too. A **face complication** says whether Grok is working or waiting on you, so the usual answer needs no app at all. The watch asks your iPhone, so the pairing token never leaves it; an answer given out of range is queued and delivered when the phone is back.
- **Home-screen and lock-screen widgets**, plus a **Live Activity** on the lock screen / Dynamic Island — pushed by the bridge, so it keeps moving with the app closed (iOS 17.2+). A widget that says *needs you* opens the session that is asking.
- **Usage** — context window, tokens, and cost per session, plus **day-by-day and per-model** totals across everything, and a push when a session's context runs low.
- **Face ID lock**, since the bridge can run commands on your machine.
- Your computer is kept **awake** for as long as a task is running, and the bridge can install itself as a **background service** so it's there after a reboot.
- **iPad** — sidebar + conversation split layout.

## Quickstart

### 1. Run the bridge (on the machine where Grok Build is installed)

Needs **Node.js 20+** and **Grok Build** installed + signed in.

```bash
npx tethrx-bridge
```

It prints a **pairing token** and its address.

**Want it always-on?** Install it as a background service — it then starts when you
log in and restarts itself if it crashes, so the bridge is still there after a reboot:

```bash
npm i -g tethrx-bridge
tethrx-bridge service install --host 0.0.0.0
```

`--host 0.0.0.0` is what makes it reachable from your phone; only do that on a network
you trust, since the pairing token is what protects the bridge. Manage it with:

```bash
tethrx-bridge service status      # installed? loaded? answering? can it see grok?
tethrx-bridge service logs        # recent output (the pairing token is redacted)
tethrx-bridge service restart
tethrx-bridge service uninstall   # sessions and pairing are left untouched
```

macOS installs a LaunchAgent, Linux a `systemd --user` unit; both run as you, never
as root. On Linux, add `loginctl enable-linger $USER` to keep it running when you're
logged out.

**Easiest pairing:** open **`http://localhost:4180/pair`** on the computer running the bridge. It shows a scannable QR code (one for Wi-Fi, one for Tailscale) plus the token to copy. That page is **loopback-only** — the token never leaves the machine.

### 2. Get the app

**[Download TethrX on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/tethrx/id6792520305)** — free, iPhone and iPad, iOS 17+.

Tap **Scan to pair** and point at a code on `localhost:4180/pair` — or enter the **bridge address** + **pairing token** by hand — then **＋** to start a session.

**Building from source instead?** `open ios/GrokRemote.xcodeproj` (Xcode 26.6+), pick a simulator or set your Team + a device, and Run. CI builds on GitHub's `macos-26` image with Xcode 26.6.

## Approvals (the headline feature)

With the ACP transport, when Grok wants to run a shell command or edit a file, the phone shows an **approval card** with the exact command and Grok's own options ("Yes, proceed" / "No, and tell Grok…"). Nothing runs until you tap.

- **On by default.** The bridge runs Grok under a **redirected HOME** so per-tool prompting is enabled *without editing your global `~/.grok/config.toml`* (it symlinks your real files and supplies its own `config.toml`).
- Set `GROK_REMOTE_ASK=0` to inherit your global grok permission config instead (e.g. if you run `always-approve` and want the phone to match).
- You still see everything either way: thoughts, `tool_call`s with their commands, live `tool_update` status + exit codes, and plans.

**Three approval settings**, per session, from the chat's toolbar:

| Setting | What goes through without asking |
|---|---|
| **Ask each time** (default) | nothing |
| **Reads only** | tools Grok itself marks read-only, so a long build stops stalling on every `cat` |
| **Auto-approve** | everything, including `rm -rf` and `git push --force` |

A session that is **blocked on you** says so in the session list, instead of looking identical to one that is busy working, and the approval push is repeated on a widening schedule until you answer it.

If a turn stops responding entirely, **Restart this session** (in the session details) ends the stuck turn and keeps the conversation. Grok's context is restored on your next message.

## Connectivity: using it away from your desk

The phone must reach the bridge. Options, easiest first:

| Setup | How | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Same Wi-Fi** | `GROK_REMOTE_HOST=0.0.0.0`, use your Mac's LAN IP | Home/office only |
| **Tailscale** (recommended) | Install on Mac + phone (same tailnet). Bind `0.0.0.0`, use the Mac's `100.x.y.z` address in the app | Works over cellular, encrypted end-to-end, no port-forwarding |
| **TLS on LAN** | `bash bridge/scripts/gen-cert.sh` then set `GROK_REMOTE_TLS_CERT` / `GROK_REMOTE_TLS_KEY` | Serves HTTPS; the app allows the self-signed cert on local networks |

Never expose the bridge directly to the public internet — it can run code on your machine. Tailscale gives you remote access without doing that.

---

## Push notifications (optional)

So you're alerted when Grok **needs approval** or **finishes** while the app is backgrounded. The bridge only pushes when no client is actively watching that session, so you're never double-notified.

**Native push (APNs).** Because the bridge is *your* server, it pushes with *your* APNs key — nothing routes through a third party. Create an APNs auth key (Keys → Apple Push Notifications service) in your Apple developer account, then add to `~/.grok-remote/config.json`:

```json
{
  "apns": {
    "keyPath": "/Users/you/.grok-remote/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8",
    "keyId": "XXXXXXXXXX",
    "teamId": "YOURTEAMID"
  }
}
```

Scope the key to **Sandbox & Production** — App Store and TestFlight builds both use the production environment. Then enable notifications in the app's Settings. Approvals arrive with **Approve / Reject** buttons on the notification itself.

> This requires an Apple developer account, so it's genuinely optional. Without it everything else works; you just won't get alerts while the app is closed.

**ntfy (no developer account needed).**

```bash
GROK_REMOTE_NTFY="https://ntfy.sh/your-secret-topic" npx tethrx-bridge
```

Subscribe to that topic in the [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh) app.

## Configuration (env)

| Var | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GROK_REMOTE_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address (`0.0.0.0` for LAN/Tailscale) |
| `GROK_REMOTE_PORT` | `4180` | Port |
| `GROK_REMOTE_TRANSPORT` | `acp` | `acp` (rich + approvals) or `headless` |
| `GROK_REMOTE_ASK` | `1` | ACP per-tool prompts (`0` = inherit global grok config) |
| `GROK_REMOTE_NTFY` | — | ntfy topic URL for push |
| `GROK_REMOTE_TLS_CERT` / `_KEY` | — | PEM paths to serve HTTPS |
| `GROK_REMOTE_CWD` | `~` | Default working directory for new sessions |
| `GROK_BIN` | auto | Path to the `grok` binary |

State (pairing token, session registry, redirected grok-home) lives in `~/.grok-remote/`.

---

## Security

- **Token auth** on every request (minted on first run, stored `0600`). The iOS app keeps it in the **Keychain**.
- Approvals mean Grok can't run a command or edit a file without your explicit tap (with `GROK_REMOTE_ASK=1`).
- Use **Tailscale or TLS** whenever the bridge is reachable beyond loopback. Nothing talks to a third party except optional ntfy pushes you configure.

---

## Roadmap

- [x] **ACP transport** — tool calls, plans, live approve/reject on the phone
- [x] **Plan mode** — Grok drafts a plan; review + approve on the phone before it builds
- [x] **Context resume across restarts** — ACP `session/load` restores conversation; event history persisted + replayed
- [x] **Lock-screen approvals** — native APNs (and ntfy) action buttons resolve a permission without opening the app
- [x] **Command output + code blocks** — see *why* something failed, not just that it did
- [x] **Git review** — changed files, per-file diffs, commit or discard from the phone
- [x] **Slash commands** — grok's built-ins and your installed skills
- [x] **Voice dictation, queued follow-ups, prompt snippets**
- [x] **Sessions** — search, folders, several paired computers
- [x] **Siri (App Intents)**, home-screen widget, Live Activity
- [x] **Sleep prevention** — the machine stays awake while a turn runs
- [x] Persistence, launchd service, TLS, Keychain, reasoning-effort picker, Face ID lock
- [ ] **Pinned HTTPS** — self-signed cert with its fingerprint in the pairing QR, so cleartext is never needed
- [ ] **Relay** — for cellular without Tailscale (`grok agent headless --grok-ws-url wss://…` exists)
- [x] **Images** — send a photo from the phone (saved for Grok's read tool; ACP still rejects image content blocks). Pictures Grok generates render in the reply.
