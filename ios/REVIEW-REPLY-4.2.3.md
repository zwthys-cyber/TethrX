Thank you for the review, and for the detail about what you ran into.

We have submitted a new build that reworks the first-run experience, and we would
also like to clarify one point about the requirement you encountered.

**Nothing needs to be installed from the App Store, or on the iPhone.** Grok Build
is not an iOS app. It is xAI's command-line coding agent for a desktop computer,
run in a terminal on a Mac or PC that the user already owns. TethrX is a remote
control for that computer, in the same way an SSH client is a remote control for a
server. The previous build's setup wizard described installing it *on the user's
computer*, which we can see read as a requirement to install another app on the
device. That wording, and its position as the first screen, was our mistake.

**What we changed in this build:**

1. **The app now opens on a working screen, not a setup checklist.** The launch
   screen is a usable workspace, and nothing on it asks the user to install
   anything.

2. **A prompt library that works entirely on the device.** From the moment the app
   is opened, with no computer, no pairing and no network, the user can write,
   dictate, edit, search, organise, copy and share reusable coding-task prompts.
   These are stored on the phone and are a permanent part of the app: they also
   appear above the message field in every session once a computer is connected.

3. **A full guided tour is now the primary button on the launch screen.** It opens
   the entire app - session list, conversation, tool approvals, file diffs,
   settings - populated with sample data and no hardware of any kind. In the
   previous build this existed only as a small text link below the setup steps,
   which is why it was easy to miss.

4. **Connecting a computer is now an optional, clearly-labelled secondary action.**
   It opens a separate screen that states up front: "These steps all happen on the
   computer you want to control. Nothing extra is needed on this phone."

**To verify without any hardware:**

- Launch the app. The first screen is the prompt workspace. Type a task into the
  "write a task…" field and tap **+** - it is saved on the device and persists
  across relaunches. Tap **Write a longer prompt** for the full editor, including
  dictation.
- Tap **Take the tour** to walk through the complete app with sample data.

Neither step requires Grok Build, a computer, a network connection, or any account.

**If you would like to test the connected experience,** the companion program is
open source and starts on any Mac with Node 20+ using a single command,
`npx tethrx-bridge`. It prints a QR code that the app scans to pair. It is
published at https://github.com/zwthys-cyber/TethrX and on npm as `tethrx-bridge`. We
are glad to provide a screen recording of the full flow if that is more convenient.

Thank you again for your time.
